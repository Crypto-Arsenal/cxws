/**
 * Implementation of the Liquid Order Book that pulls information
 * from the Liquid Web Socket feed defined here:
 * https://developers.liquid.com/#public-channels
 *
 * Liquid does not provide timestamps or sequence identifiers with their
 * order book stream. The stream acts as a psuedo snapshot stream in
 * that each "update" message is actually the top 40 items in one side
 * of the book (ask or bid). Therefore, the update processing simply
 * replaces one side of the book.
 *
 * # Example
 *
 * ```javascript
 * const client = new ccxtws.liquid();
 * const market = { id: "btceur", base: "BTC", quote: "EUR" };
 * const ob = new LiquidOrderBook();
 *
 * client.subscribeLevel2Updates(market);
 * client.on("l2update", update => {
 *   ob.update(update);
 * });
 * ```
